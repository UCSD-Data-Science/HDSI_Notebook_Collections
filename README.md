## Pointers Page
This page is a holding place for pointers to web pages and git repositories. 

**Yoav** Currently, there is no QA, and the resolution is very course - basically pointing to whole repositories.
before we advertise this, I would like to have a resolution down to single ipynb files and also QA by asking different people to replicate the operation of the notebook. This replication might include pip installs or docker images.



### Pointers to course web pages:
* [Micro-Masters in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/data-science)
* [CSE103: UCSD undergrad course in probability and statistics using python](https://cse103.github.io/)
* [MAS-DSE](https://mas-dse.github.io/)

### Pointers to git repositories
* [Classification of echo-location clicks from two species of whales](https://github.com/yoavfreund/BeakedWhaleClassification) Work with John Hildebrand.
* [notebooks with examples of tensor-flow](https://github.com/ucsd-edx/TensorFlow-Examples) adapted from notebooks for aymericdamien
